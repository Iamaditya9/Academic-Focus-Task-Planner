## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iamaditya9/Academic-Focus-Task-Planner.git
cd Academic-Focus-Task-Planner
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### 5. Run tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

## API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Application dashboard |
| `GET` | `/login` | Login page |
| `POST` | `/login` | Create session |
| `GET` | `/logout` | End session |
| `GET` | `/tasks` | Retrieve tasks |
| `POST` | `/tasks` | Create a task |
| `PATCH` | `/tasks/<id>` | Update task completion |
| `DELETE` | `/tasks/<id>` | Delete a task |
| `GET` | `/export` | Export tasks as CSV |

## Testing

The project includes automated tests for the core task workflow, including:

- Creating tasks
- Retrieving tasks
- Updating completion status
- Deleting tasks

Run the complete test suite with:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Engineering Focus

This project demonstrates practical software engineering concepts:

- REST-style backend endpoints
- CRUD operations
- Relational data persistence
- Server-side rendering with Jinja2
- Client-server communication with JavaScript `fetch`
- Input validation and error handling
- Automated API/application testing
- CSV data export
- Modular project organization

## Security Note

The current authentication is intended for a local/demo application. A production deployment would require stronger authentication and authorization, password hashing, CSRF protection, user-specific data ownership, secure secret management, and a production database.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Real user authentication
- [ ] User-specific task ownership
- [ ] Task editing
- [ ] PostgreSQL support
- [ ] Calendar integration
- [ ] Deadline notifications
- [ ] Docker deployment
- [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Cloud deployment
